Summary of Changes to Tk::IDElayout

Release 0.32:  9/18/08

 * Fixed bug where the status line would vanish if the whole window was expanded and then shrunk.
 * Updated Makefile.PL so CPAN (hopefully) will understand that Tk is required for this module.
     (Since Tk was required for just running the Makefile.PL, this was more complicated than just
      adding to PREREQ_PM.)

Release 0.31:  9/20/07

 * Updated to work with Graph packages greater than version .3
 * Fixed memory leak where widgets where not being destroyed after the tabs that contained
   them were closed.

Release 0.3:  9/16/07

 * First Public Release.
